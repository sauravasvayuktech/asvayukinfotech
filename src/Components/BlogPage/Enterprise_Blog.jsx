                                        <p>An enterprise portal is a central point of integration that brings together multiple applications, data sources, and services. It is a portal for employees, partners, and customers to retrieve information and work together effectively. By combining several different functions into one interface, an enterprise portal can greatly increase workflow and user experience.</p>
