                                        <p>
                                            Blockchain is an open-source, distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It offers massive data storage across several computers in a network, which cannot be easily tampered with or hacked. Blockchain's potential goes beyond cryptocurrency, promising revolutionary solutions in finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more.
